# Oblique Strategies

This is a port of the original (Ruby) [nodanaonlyzuul/oblique_stratagies](https://github.com/nodanaonlyzuul/oblique_strategies). Mostly as a chance to get better at Golang.
It's a work in progress, no judgey.

## Installing

1.  Pull this repository.
2.  `go build ./oblique_stratagies.go` (creates the executable `oblique_stratagies`)
3.  Put the executable somewhere in your `$PATH` or run it via absolute path.

## Use in Code

I'd like to make this a library, not just an executable. So other programs can use cards,
and even add the ability to bring your own deck. That's in the works.
